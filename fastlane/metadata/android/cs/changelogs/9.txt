*Whats New in this Update*

* Now app uses Tesseract 5, Which is 50% faster than previous version (as claimed).
* Now app uses 'fast' trained data as default.
* Base Libraries(Leptonica,libjpeg,libpng) updated.
* Enabled Fast Float(This will increase performance 2x when using 'best' trained data )
* Compiled with NEON SIMD, This greatly improve processing time when using LSTM engine with 'standard' or 'fast' trained data.
* For more info See Tesseract4Android library repo.
